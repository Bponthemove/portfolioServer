# portfolioServer
server code for portfolio

This back end is hosted on heroku. 
Build with Express, mongo/mongoose and authorization with Userfront.

Used for blog part of the portfolio site, where you can comment, like/dislike posts.
I have assigned a test username which you can use to login as member to comment as like/dislike, just so that you do not have to go through the process of siging up.
